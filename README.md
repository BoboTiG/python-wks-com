# Python Inverter COM

Python module to communicate with WKS EKO Circle inverters.

## Installation

```console
$ python -m pip install inverter-com
```

## Utility

When installing the module, the `inverter-com` program is made available.
You can use it to send commands to inverters, and see what data you can get from.

The usage is as follow:

```console
$ inverter-com SERIAL_PORT COMMAND
$ inverter-com SERIAL_PORT ALIAS
```

As an example, here is how to retrieve the inverter serial number:

```console
$ inverter-com /dev/ttyUSB0 QID
```

The output will be something like that:

```log
DEBUG:inverter_com.inverter:/dev/ttyUSB0 > SEND 'QIDÖê\r'
DEBUG:inverter_com.inverter:/dev/ttyUSB0 > WRITTEN 6 chars (OK)
DEBUG:inverter_com.inverter:/dev/ttyUSB0 < RAW b'(96332309100452?\xf3\r'
DEBUG:inverter_com.inverter:/dev/ttyUSB0 < DECODED '96332309100452'
"96332309100452"
```

### Available Commands

You can send any commands as defined in the official documentation, and even unknown commands.

There are also aliases you could use:

- `flags` for the `QFLAG` command;
- `metrics` for the `QPGS0` command;
- `metrics-n` (where `n` is a number between 1 and 9) for the `QPGSn` command;
- `ratings` for the `QPIRI` command;
- `settings` for the `QDI` command;

When the inverter does not understand a command, it will return the `NAK` keyword.
